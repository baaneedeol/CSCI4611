# Assignment 2: Hole in the Ground
Name: Baanee Singh

UMN Internet ID: sing0931@umn.edu

Third Party Assets: none

Wizard Functionality: I don't think this counts, but I did restrict the movements of the hole so the edge of the hole doesn't cross over the white boundary line. I also created random colors, sizes, positions, and velocities for stage 2 of the game.
